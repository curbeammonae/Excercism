// To determine the letters for the front door password, you need to respond with the first letter of the line of the poem, that the guard recites to you.

// To end up with a nice password, the members of the poetry club like to use acrostic poems. This means that the first letter of each sentence forms a word. Here is an example by one of their favorite writers Michael Lockwood.

// Stands so high
// Huge hooves too
// Impatiently waits for
// Reins and harness
// Eager to leave
// So when the guard recites Stands so high, you'll respond S, when the guard recites Huge hooves too, you'll respond H.

// Implement the function frontDoorResponse that takes a line of the poem as an argument and returns the first letter of that line.

// frontDoorResponse('Stands so high');
// // => "S"

function frontDoorResponse(line) {
    return line[0]
  }
